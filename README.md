# Docker Minecraft PaperMC Server 1.16.5

Docker Minecraft PaperMC server 1.16.x, 1.15.2, 1.14.4 (legacy) or 1.13.2 (legacy)

## Quick Start
```sh
docker pull marctv/minecraft-papermc-server
```

```sh
docker run \
  --rm \
  --name mcserver \
  -e MEMORYSIZE='1G' \
  -v /homes/joe/mcserver:/data:rw \
  -p 25565:25565 \
-i marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
```
```sh
docker attach mcserver
```

## Volume

You can use volumes to store data persistantly, for example:

```sh
docker run --rm \
	-p 25565:25565 \
	-v <full path to folder where you want to store the server files>:/data:rw \
	marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
 ```

## Docker Compose

If you prefer to use `docker-compose`, use the following commands:

Start the server:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Stop the server:
```sh
docker-compose stop
```
Issue server commands after attaching to the container:
```sh
docker attach mcserver
# then you can type things like "list"
list
# which will show the current players online or
help
# to see all the commands available
```

## How to use the Makefile with Docker Compose 

Additionally, a `Makefile` is provided to easily start, stop, and attach to the container.

```sh
make start     # equivalent to `docker-compose up -d --build`
make stop      # equivalent to `docker-compose stop --rmi all --remove-orphans`
make attach    # equivalent to `docker attach mcserver`
make help      # prints a help message
```

## Environment variable

MEMORYSIZE = 1G

Not more than 70% of your RAM for your Container! This is important! This is the RAM your Minecraft Server will use within the container WITHOUT the operating system.

TZ = Europe/Berlin 

Sets the timezone for the container.
